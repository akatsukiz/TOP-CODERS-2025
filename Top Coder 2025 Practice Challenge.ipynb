Number 1 takes 2 segments (b,c) to display, so to change from 6 to 1 (a,f,g,e,d) has to be turned off and (b) has to be turned on. Hence a total of 6 segments needs to be changed.\n",

Number 5 takes 5 segments (a,f,g,c,d) to display, so (c) are already turned on so they need not be considered. Hence a total of 3 segments (b -> off) and (a,d -> on) need be changed.\n",
